      Bali can be as it is because the indigenous Balinese people still maintain
      the culture and traditions of their predecessors. And, we as migrants who
      have already fallen in love with this island – this land, this culture –
      it's time we all realize that we are part of its nature. Let's help our
      "home" become a better place. For everyone...

      At Pesthama, we pledge to help sustain the environment by promoting
      plant-based solutions, such as Neem Oil, as an alternative to chemical
      compounds for: pest control, organic agriculture and permaculture, and
      health and cosmetics.  Providing support to local communities matters to
      us: we strive to raise awareness about environmental protection,
      sustainable constructions, and to help develop organic agriculture in
      remote areas of Bali. We engaged in a long and passionate research over 10
      years to find environment-friendly, organic solutions for pest control and
      farming that were safe to handle and apply, residue-free, and with the
      lowest carbon rate possible. Neem Oil stood out as the ideal component and
      the Pesthama range was born. As Pesthama’s team members, we pledge to
      respect the Spirit of Bali, its culture and its natural environment.
